I am the endowed chair for brain imaging at the University of South Carolina in the Department of Psychology. I lead the [Neuroimaging Core](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/lOK9ctRXQUGmo5-rgvrlUA/project-details/10817181) and am the Co-Project Lead for Center for the [brain health project](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/HmrmqpHGS0mPbG_UWQALYQ/project-details/10817163) of the [Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery](https://cstar.sc.edu/). I lead the development of the [NiiVue](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/dNfNq05F10WBBWtJH_hp0A/project-details/10724895) neurimaging visualization project.

I helped create and lead development of several popular GitHub repositories:

 - [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) converts complicated and manufacturer-specific medical imaging data into the simpler NIfTI format popular in neuroimaging sciences. This converter extracts [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) sequence details that allow reproducible science and curated data. The permissive license and minimal dependencies have led it to be included with many popular tools in the field.
 - [MRIcron](https://github.com/neurolabusc/MRIcron) is a light-weight and [popular](https://www.nitrc.org/top/toplist.php?type=downloads) cross-platform visualization tool for neuroimaging.
 - [MRIcroGL](https://github.com/rordenlab/MRIcroGL) uses the capabilities of modern graphics cards to generate compelling volume rendering visualizations of voxel-based images.
 - [Surfice](https://github.com/neurolabusc/surf-ice) uses the capabilities of modern graphics cards to generate compelling surface rendering visualizations of mesh-based data.
 - [nii2mesh](https://github.com/neurolabusc/nii2mesh) converts voxel-based images to surface meshes and is can be used [from a web page](https://rordenlab.github.io/nii2meshWeb/) without requiring any software to be installed.
 - [NiiVue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue) is a modular visualization tool for neuroimaging meshes and volumes. It can be inserted into [web-pages](https://niivue.github.io/niivue/) supporting cloud interface, edge computing and stanalone applications. I am co-originator and co-lead development with @hanayik.
